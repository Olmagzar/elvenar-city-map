This is a firefox extension to directly download one's own city from the game
webpage.
It uses the player game generated hash credentials to request the details of the
city and filter it to only keep:
- city buildings and unlocked areas     (EA/DL)
- city race                             (EA/DL)
- cultural bonus                        (EA/DL)
- completed provinces                   (EA/DL)
- squadsize                             (EA/DL)
- relics count                          (EA/DL)
- relics boosts                         (EA/DL)
- encounter and tournament points       (EA/DL)
- username                              (DL)
- player_id                             (ES)
- world/country                         (ES/DL)

Note: EA=ElvenArchitect usage, DL=Download usage, ES=ElvenStats usage.

The menu is displayed when the extension is clicked, in the url address bar,
suggesting to:
1. Upload one's own city to ElvenArchitect with cultural bonus set, squadsize
   set, relics details filled, etc.
2. Open one's own ElvenStats profile in a new tab thanks to the player_id and
   world informations, if the profile already exists (ElvenStats updates about
   once a week)
3. Download one's own city in a file. The format is the same as the one
   supported by ElvenArchitect, a base64 encoded json structure.
4. Refresh the stored representation of one's own city to get the last changes
   the player made since the last refresh or the start of the game.
